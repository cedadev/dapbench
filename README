WARNING: this is pre-alpha code

The intention is to develop a method of:

1. Capturing OPeNDAP requests made through the NetCDF4-API by any
high-level tool and producing statistics on request size, frequency
and timespan.

2. Simulate multiple users interacting with a server over OPeNDAP and
gather statistics.
